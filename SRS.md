# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) defines the functional, non-functional, technical, and quality requirements of the **Inventory Management System** developed as part of the BBAT104 Fundamentals of TQM course project.

The system is an **offline desktop-based inventory management application** designed to allow a user to securely manage inventory data stored locally on the computer.

The primary quality objective of the system is **Faster Search & Retrieval (Q13)**. The system will therefore emphasize efficient database queries, quick-search functionality, search filters, and sorting mechanisms.

---

## 1.2 Project Objective

The main objective of the project is to develop a reliable and user-friendly inventory management application that allows users to:

- Create and manage an inventory database.
- Add, view, update, and delete inventory records.
- Quickly search for products.
- Filter inventory according to different attributes.
- Sort inventory records.
- Retrieve relevant records efficiently using optimized SQLite queries.
- Secure the application using a local user account and password.
- Operate completely without requiring an Internet connection.

The TQM quality goal assigned to this project is:

> **Q13 — Faster Search & Retrieval**

The official project guidelines associate Q13 with **Search Filters, Sorting Options, Dashboard Quick-Search, and Database Query Optimization**. These four capabilities constitute the core MVP quality features of this project.

**Python 3.x**

Python will be used for:
- Application logic.
- Database interaction.
- Authentication.
- Search and filtering.
- Sorting.
- CRUD operations.
- Performance measurement.
- TQM/SQC chart generation.

The official guidelines specify Python 3.x as the core runtime. 

---

## 4.2 User Interface

**CustomTkinter**

CustomTkinter will be used to create the desktop graphical user interface.

The interface will contain:
- Login screen.
- Account creation screen.
- Dashboard.
- Inventory management screen.
- Search interface.
- Filter controls.
- Sorting controls.
- Settings screen.
- Notifications and validation messages.

The official guidelines allow Tkinter/CustomTkinter for GUI development. 

---

## 4.3 Database

**SQLite3**

SQLite3 will be used as the local database management system.

The database will store:
- User account information.
- Authentication-related information.
- Inventory records.
- Product information.
- Application preferences where appropriate.

The database must persist after application shutdown.

Every successful database modification must be committed using an appropriate transaction mechanism.

---

# 5. User Workflow

## 5.1 First Application Launch

When the application is launched for the first time:

```text
Application Launch
       ↓
Check Local Database
       ↓
Does User Account Exist?
       ↓
      NO
       ↓
Account Creation Screen
       ↓
Create Username + Password
       ↓
Save Account Locally
       ↓
Login / Dashboard
```

The system shall detect that no local user account exists and guide the user through account creation.

---

## 5.2 Subsequent Application Launch

When the application is opened after an account has already been created:

```text
Application Launch
       ↓
Check Authentication State
       ↓
Keep Me Logged In?
    ↙          ↘
   YES          NO
    ↓            ↓
 Dashboard    Login Screen
                 ↓
             Password
                 ↓
          Authentication
             ↙      ↘
          Correct   Incorrect
             ↓         ↓
        Dashboard   Error Message
```

If the Keep Me Logged In preference is enabled, the application may directly open the dashboard according to the locally stored authentication state.

If it is disabled, the application shall require the user to authenticate.

---

# 6. Functional Requirements

The system shall determine whether a local user account has already been configured.

If no account exists, the system shall display the account creation interface.

---

## FR-02 — Account Creation

The system shall allow the user to create a local application account.

The account shall contain at minimum:
- Username.
- Password.

The system shall validate required fields before creating the account.

---

## FR-03 — Password Authentication

The system shall require authentication before granting access to protected application functionality.

The entered password shall be compared with the locally stored authentication information.

Incorrect authentication attempts shall result in an appropriate error message.

---

## FR-04 — Keep Me Logged In

The login screen shall provide a **Keep Me Logged In** option.

When enabled, the application shall remember the user's authentication state according to the application's local authentication mechanism.

When disabled, the application shall require authentication during subsequent launches.

---

- Stock Status
- Date/Time of Update

The final database fields may be refined during database design.

---

## FR-07 — View Inventory

Changes shall be saved persistently to the SQLite database.

---

## FR-09 — Delete Inventory

The system shall allow the user to delete an inventory record.

The system should request confirmation before permanently deleting a record.

---

## FR-10 — Data Persistence

Inventory data shall remain available after:

- Closing the application.
- Restarting the application.
- Restarting the computer.

The application shall not recreate or reset the database during normal startup.

---

# 8. Q13 — Faster Search & Retrieval Requirements

This section represents the **core quality objective of the project**.

The official Q13 goal is **Faster Search & Retrieval**, with the suggested features of Search Filters, Sorting Options, Dashboard Quick-Search, and Database Query Optimization. 

## FR-11 — Dashboard Quick-Search

The dashboard shall provide a prominent quick-search field.

The user shall be able to enter a search term and quickly retrieve matching inventory records.

Possible search fields may include:
- Product ID.

The final searchable fields will be determined during database design.

---

## FR-12 — Search Filters

The inventory interface shall provide filters allowing the user to narrow the displayed results.

Possible filters include:

Multiple filters should be capable of being applied together where technically appropriate.

---

## FR-13 — Sorting Options

The system shall allow inventory records to be sorted according to relevant attributes.

Possible sorting options include:

- Product Name.
- Product ID.
- Quantity.
- Price.
- Category.
- Last Updated.

The user should be able to choose ascending or descending order where applicable.

---

## FR-14 — Database Query Optimization

The application shall avoid unnecessarily loading the complete inventory dataset into Python when the database can efficiently perform the required filtering or search operation.

---

## FR-15 — Search Performance Measurement

The system development process shall include measurement of search/retrieval performance.

Performance measurements may include:

- Query execution time.
- Number of records searched.
- Number of records returned.
